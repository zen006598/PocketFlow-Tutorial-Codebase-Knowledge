This is a tutorial project of [Pocket Flow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a 100-line LLM framework. It crawls GitHub repositories and build a knowledge base from the code. It analyzes entire codebases to identify core abstractions and how they interact, and transforms complex code into beginner-friendly tutorials with clear visualizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

2. Install dependencies: 

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Generate a complete codebase tutorial by running the main script:

  ```bash
  python main.py https://github.com/username/repo --include "*.py" "*.js" --exclude "tests/*" --max-size 50000
  ```
  
  - `repo_url` - URL of the GitHub repository (required)
  - `-n, --name` - Project name (optional, derived from URL if omitted)
  - `-t, --token` - GitHub token (or set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable)
  - `-o, --output` - Output directory (default: ./output)
  - `-i, --include` - Files to include (e.g., "*.py" "*.js")
  - `-e, --exclude` - Files to exclude (e.g., "tests/*" "docs/*")
  - `-s, --max-size` - Maximum file size in bytes (default: 100KB)

- Crawl GitHub repositories at specific commits or branches
- Filter files by patterns (include/exclude)
- Set maximum file size limits
- Generate relative paths for simpler directory structures

The application will crawl the repository, analyze the codebase structure, generate tutorial content, and save the output in the specified directory (default: ./output).


## 💡 Development Tutorial

- I built using [**Agentic Coding**](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/agentic-coding-the-most-fun-way-to), the fastest development paradigm, where humans simply [design](docs/design.md) and agents [code](flow.py).

- The secret weapon is [Pocket Flow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a 100-line LLM framework that lets Agents (e.g., Cursor AI) build for you
